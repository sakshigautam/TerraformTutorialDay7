# ðŸš€ Terraform Tutorial Series â€“ Day 7: Terraform Modules (Basics)

Welcome to **Day 7** of the **Terraform Tutorial Series**!  
In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore **Terraform Modules** â€” one of the most powerful features of Terraform that helps you **organize**, **reuse**, and **scale** your infrastructure code efficiently.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand **what modules** are and **why** theyâ€™re important  
- Create your **first custom module**  
- Use **public modules** from the Terraform Registry  
- Modularize your infrastructure for **better reusability and scalability**

---

## ðŸ§  What Are Terraform Modules?

A **Terraform module** is a **container for multiple resources** that are used together.  
Think of it as a **function in programming** â€“ it groups related resources and can be called multiple times with different inputs.

### âœ… Benefits of Using Modules

- **Reusability** â€“ Write once, reuse everywhere  
- **Organization** â€“ Keep your Terraform code structured and readable  
- **Consistency** â€“ Maintain uniform configurations across environments  
- **Collaboration** â€“ Share modules across teams or projects  



Hereâ€™s the folder layout weâ€™ll use in this example:
